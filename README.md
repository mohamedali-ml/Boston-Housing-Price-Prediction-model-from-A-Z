# üè† Boston House Price Prediction - ML Model Deployment with MLOps from A to Z üöÄ

Welcome to the Boston House Price Prediction project! This repository showcases a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting Boston house prices, covering everything from model building to deployment, monitoring, versioning, and CI/CD. This project is designed to demonstrate production-level MLOps practices and guide students or developers through building, managing, and deploying ML applications.

### Key Features üìå

1. **Model Building**: Train and tune a regression model on the classic Boston housing dataset, leveraging best practices for feature engineering and model evaluation.
2. **Data Versioning with DVC**: Track and version the dataset and models with DVC, ensuring reproducibility and organized data management.
3. **Model Registry**: Implement a model registry to keep track of model versions, making it easy to roll back or deploy updates.
4. **API and Deployment with Streamlit**: Use Streamlit to design an intuitive API for model inference and deploy it in a Docker container for seamless scalability.
5. **Containerization with Docker**: Build a Dockerized application to ensure consistent deployment across different environments.
6. **Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deployment on each commit, ensuring a robust and reliable application.
7. **Monitoring & A/B Testing**: Monitor model performance in real-time, and use A/B testing to compare model versions and make data-driven improvements.
8. **Full Documentation & Walkthrough**: Detailed steps, code, and explanations make it easy to follow each part of the project from start to finish.

### Tech Stack üîß
- **Programming**: Python, Streamlit
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Data Version Control**: DVC
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Continuous Integration & Deployment**: GitHub Actions
